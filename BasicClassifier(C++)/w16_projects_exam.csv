3304,in9pqfgb1or2r,57,exam,1,2016-04-21T03:12:46Z,3,1470666451575,imagine we have 3 classes base derived1 derived such that derived2 is a derived1 and derived1 is a base now lets say all 3 of them have a function f1 which is nonvirtual in base but virtual in both derived1 and derived2 its clear that if a derived1 object calls f1 it would run the base version of f1 because the function isnt virtual in base however if a derived2 object called f1 would it be virtual since derived2s direct parent class implements a virtual version of this function

2673,imp0n0tk86f3h7,133,calculator,0,2016-04-06T15:34:53Z,4,1470666601422,so in the spec and the rmes it talks about doing operator overloads for the list class and for the iterator class however per the lecture slides and in the project it seems like i frequently find myself using operators for nodes which i have no overloads written for them such as assignment and comparison should wecan we write operator overloads for these node operators
2672,imoxtllxgun7a8,149,calculator,0,2016-04-06T14:16:01Z,5,1470666601651,im sure i am doing something wrong but i cannot figure out what i have become frustrated with various bugs in my listh file so i decided temporarily to reduce the code complexity to just implementing the default constructor because i couldnt figure out how to get the code to call the default constructor or at least print out the text message that i placed inside the curly braces of that default constructor however after taking out 98 of the implementation and recompiling my test program the compiler still finds implementations somehow of all of the old functions despite them not existing any more beyond declarations of functions for example valgrind states i have a have an invalid read of size four from a function that isnt implemented in listh what am i doing wrong what is g actually compiling and working with if it isnt listh

2641,imnp2ot0eai1m9,157,calculator,0,2016-04-05T17:23:23Z,8,1470666608136,do we necessarily have to assert that the invariants are met when implementing rationalcpp for example invariant 1 is that the denominator must always be 0 and the numerator must be positive now if i merely asserted that statement in the constructor input such as rational 10 3 would fail even though that input should be modified to be appear as rational 10 3 so instead of asserting these statements i created functions that look for situations described in the invariants and modify the values if they are found to violate a condition is this method allowed

1170,ikrhox5mcfo5e8,217,image,0,2016-02-17T23:48:23Z,5,1470666963052,so for the 3rd image init what exactly is the interaction between the matrix and the image doesnt the image already hold 3 matrices for the r g and blue values can we just fill these matrices with max intensities what is the need for another matrix

1164,ikrfhfalmjl32f,81,image,0,2016-02-17T22:46:34Z,5,1470666964420,is it ok if we include two functions in the same test case for example it makes sense to have a single test case for both matrixheight and matrixwidth rather than testing them in separate functions
1163,ikrf54hi30o6if,91,image,0,2016-02-17T22:37:00Z,4,1470666964621,i realized that my testing of the width height and imageinit with width and height as parameters will basically all be the exact same code as to test the init function i use the getwidth and getheight functions would it be sufficient to test all three of these functions in one test function or should i find another way to test them separately

1155,ikrczyz1gj74dk,130,image,0,2016-02-17T21:37:00Z,3,1470666966547,for testing the imagecpp file ive found that i use many of the image functions to set up images for my test cases for example in the imageinit test functions ive been using setpixel fill and the other init functions to create images to compare to the image created by the function test being implemented so for the init that passes a matrix as a parameter i create two images one using that function specifically and one using a different init function and manually filling the image using other means to create an exact copy of what should be created by just using the one init function the reason i think this may be an issue is that technically im using some functions before running the test for it and regardless of the order i run my tests in this will still happen is that okay

1116,ikq3fqb1kv74ax,120,image,1,2016-02-17T00:21:33Z,5,1470666976143,im still very confused about the ppm are files like dogcostcorrecttxt and horsecostcorrecttxt in the starter files ppm if so why they are not in the correct format for example the following is what dogcostcorrecttxt contains it has width and height in the first line however where do p3plain ppm file and 225max value for rgb go also if the rgb value is 1470 for a pixel how do i determine what its individual elementredgreenblue is it seems like there are more than one combinations for example in this case red can be 1 green 47 and blue 0 it can also be interpreted as red 14 green 7 blue 0 so how can i tell which combination is true
1115,ikq38murjxgbw,216,image,0,2016-02-17T00:16:02Z,8,1470666976328,effects initializes the image to be a normalized grayscale representation of the data stored in the matrix that is the values in the matrix are normalized to maxintensity and then used to initialize the red green and blue components of each pixel in the image does this mean the values are already normalized or do we need to normalize them by multiplying by 255 before assigning them to the color channels
