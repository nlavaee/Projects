1708,htz95a58r3yhr,95,student,0,2014-04-14T04:19:16Z,5,1470677969641,remember that these invariants must hold after the rational object is constructed and throughout its lifetime but they do not apply to the two parameters passed in to the constructor the parameters passed into the constructor can be arbitrary integers and the constructor should always succeed accordingly your implementation of the constructor must manipulate pq based on equivalences eg reducing the fraction moving or canceling the negative signs to satisfy the invariants the parameters passed into the constructor can be arbitrary integers and the constructor should always succeed ok to me this says hey pin and qin can be whatever the hell the user want them to be 00 00 11 01 01 etc either im incorrect or the code visualization is wrong thoughts clarification donuts
1707,htz8ojmkn282c6,102,student,1,2014-04-14T04:06:15Z,6,1470677969851,so if i wanted to write a helper function in rationalcpp static void checkinvariants const is this something i could do i know p and q are private variables but if i declared this function a friend function i could be able to access p and q but that would require me to modify rationalcpp which we are not allowed to do thoughts if this is not possible im guessing i just have to manually ensure that p and q follow the representation invariants when i create a rational object via either the default the pin qin constructor or fetch the p and q values via getp and getq this seems like poor inefficient code structure to me but if i have to do this its fine

1183,hswmnlo4flf30s,112,student,0,2014-03-18T03:34:25Z,5,1470678072550,so i was testing and came across this certain bug in my playermaketrump for instance if table is set up such that the players are alice bob alice drew 0 1 2 3 so it turns out that alice has same name as dealer and it also turns out that making goes to round 2 since dealers name is also alice at round 2 after say bob passes the other alice orders because of screw the dealer rule however the code mistakes it for dealer as my code in playermaketrump for round 2 checks for dealer by name so does that mean the way i am checking for dealer is wrong or this case is an exception to what we are suppose to test thanks

253,hqv4rvxuogrgl,151,student,0,2014-01-25T17:06:41Z,4,1470678342977,hello in the accumulate function our accumulate function is written such that it depends on another fn eg add product even if we have written the accumulate function such that it is tail recursive just do exactly what the effects prompt tells us to do is it still tail recursive when the fn such as add is not tail recursive in other words i can see that my accumulate stack frame can be continuously reused but it calls an x amount of add stack frames where x is the number of elements in the list

2810,i3ko6qd5kq44eh,61,student,1,2014-12-11T22:00:49Z,3,1470679097432,lets say you have virtual and pure virtual functions in a base class and then you implement them in a derived class and then you make a derived class from that derived class that only needs to reimplement some of the functions implemented in the first derived class if you made an instance of the second derived class and called a function that was only defined in the first derived class would it just default to using the instance implemented in the first derived class or is this illegal
2809,i3knhtjogg2v8,60,student,0,2014-12-11T21:41:26Z,2,1470679097687,so prof deorio said we should be familiar with intset for the exam what specifically does that mean should we know about its member functions and variables or are we expected to know all the code behind it

2807,i3kmjutv5v56v1,82,student,0,2014-12-11T21:15:02Z,2,1470679098227,for the overloaded assignment operator how come the first line is removefoodsif truepredconst food it seems like you should need something in the parentheses of truepered in order to use the overloaded bool operator or else it would just call the default constructor and also how come you dont have to set toplayer rhstoplayer how are we supposed to know that copyalllayers does this for us
2806,i3km6r2yyblqk,55,student,0,2014-12-11T21:04:50Z,2,1470679098456,are overloaded operators inherited by derived classes

2802,i3khgh6gdgg188,80,student,0,2014-12-11T18:52:26Z,3,1470679099541,i know that destructors have to be virtual in polymorphism when the destructor is run the virtual destructor for that derived class is run and then moves backwards to the base class for normal virtual functions doesnt it just run the dynamic type virtual function doesnt call the previous parent classes virtual functions is this just a special case for virtual destructors or is my understanding of virtual functions incorrect

2797,i3kesxo6w2u4lz,65,student,0,2014-12-11T17:38:08Z,3,1470679100814,are we supposed to know the instances of when the copy constructor is used for copying as opposed to the assignment operator being used i subtly remember professor deorio saying something in lecture about how he didnt want us to focus on the little details of it but im not sure if this is what he was talking about when he said that how can we tell which of the two methods of copying will be used
2796,i3keifppdoq77m,78,student,1,2014-12-11T17:29:59Z,3,1470679101051,lets say you have int p new int5 then you call delete p does that mean that the int5 on the heap is deleted and p on the stack is deleted or does p wait until the end of the scope to be deleted thanks for the help

2345,i39i2obsdwd3d,108,student,0,2014-12-04T02:24:14Z,2,1470679223922,i know a lot of questions are being asked about what happens to the iterator after erase runs and i wanted to clarify something as i understand it after erase runs the iterator becomes invalid does this mean that iterator is now garbage and has to be set to something else for example you cant do iteratorerase and then iterator or iterator or do anything else with it before saying iterator listbegin again this seems to be the way it should work because at least for me the and other operatorsfunctions all require things like nodeptrnext or nodeptrdatum and these are not possible once erase runs and sets nodeptr to null

2177,i3368ehaa866cg,114,student,0,2014-11-29T16:06:08Z,2,1470679267563,hi i have question about the term invalided which has been mentioned a lot by instructors answering all sort of question related to erase since we are making the erase function pass by value there is no way to really invalidate the iterator inside the erase function even if i make the nodeptr of iterator points to null it just invalidate the copy of the iterator the nodeptr in the original iterator is still pointing to that piece of memorythe erased node we just recycled wouldnt that be a issue for the iterator is still sticking with a node erased rather than points to null

2047,i2om3bxct6oq5,67,student,0,2014-11-19T11:33:33Z,3,1470679300124,in the spec for the rules of an ace if any being hard it says if the players hand totals 11 or less he always hits is this scenario of the hand total is less than 11 with a hard ace ever even possible for example for the ace card to be more advantageous for the either player it would be assigned 11 soft off the bat if total hand count is still under 21 for any situation when total hand count goes over 21 and ace is still 11soft then ace would turn to hard 1 22 is the lowest number to bust thus 22 11 11 means the other nonace cards add up to 11 and we cannot change these values thus soft ace changed to hard ace would lead to 22111 12 another example if two aces are the first two dealt cards to the player then total hand count would be 12 to be more advantageous to the player thus hand count less than 11 will a hard count could not apply here i just cant think of an example where this specification would be true and i am not sure how to go about it for writing a test case
2045,i2ofloox99v6ql,82,student,0,2014-11-19T08:31:52Z,3,1470679300626,i wanted to change my betting function for certain values of count i read other posts about getcount which doesnt work since you are using a player but getcount is not declared in playerh how should i obtain count in my derived class competitor would i have to make competitor be a derived class of simple and copy paste the expose and shuffled code

1982,i2mozuk193o26t,62,student,0,2014-11-18T03:19:17Z,3,1470679318347,in the projecte description there is no specified strategy for drawing cards for the counting player does this mean that she should follow the same strategy as the simple player

1978,i2mmsq3aeno52f,98,student,0,2014-11-18T02:17:46Z,4,1470679319410,in other words how long until the autograder or person grader gets sick of letting the test cases cuts it off and says its a failure i ask as my player test just for counting takes about 13210000000 13410000000 computations basically im testing every darn possibility on multiple levels in other words for every possible exposing set of cards of size n which has 13n possibilities do either one set of 10000000 or another 10000000 tests based off of the players count oh and plus another set of tests for something else too much fun with for loops at the moment i have a bug and just letting it cout a little bit of information for every test 3 couts as i have some sort of error either in playercpp or in my tests this is taking far too long just for couting so a better question would be what would be reasonable im not sure how crazy the bugs would be including exposing the player a hundred cards and on the 101th theres a bug to reset the count to 0 what are the limits to the insane possibilities of bugs the given playercpps will have a reasonable student as the bugs seem to be based off of that could do anything and apparently doing stressboundary tests at the same time is a really bad decision help oh 281 will be such hellish fun
1977,i2mmojmqyew19m,71,student,1,2014-11-18T02:14:31Z,4,1470679319681,when you use the function getrank it returns a value that is not truly representative of the cards actual rank for example if you call get rank of a two it returns 0 because of enum layout of the array of card ranks should we be creating a helper function that returns cards actual rank by calling getrank and adding 2 in other words will we get points of if we say if cgetrank 0 when were really checking if the cards rank equals 2 is 0 in this case considered an unexplained or magic number

1733,i2dro9o7tel3cd,95,student,0,2014-11-11T21:24:20Z,2,1470679390758,for the number of cards remaining if you deal two cards then shuffle then deal another two cards and check how many cards were remaining it would be 48 right because the deck was never reset or should the next pointer always be reset to the first card in the deck in the shuffle function which would make the above answer 2

1540,i1zyeqy6rlf3os,160,student,0,2014-11-02T05:24:07Z,3,1470679442126,i saw this funky looking piece of code in cardh effects writes the card to the stream for example two of spades stdostream operator stdostream os const card c are we to also implement that inside of cardcpp if so how do i start ive tried doing something like cardoperator but that isnt working not sure what to do with this function
1539,i1zy4nnruxe5x0,171,student,0,2014-11-02T05:16:16Z,4,1470679442364,so i am running into an issue when trying to include needed files in my playertests i started off by only including the h files this became an issues because there were no abstractions for my derived classes in the playerh file so my tests didnt know that the derived classes i had written existed so i then tried to include the playercpp file so that my tests could see those derived classes but then the compiler whined to me about a redeclaration of the playerfactory function because it has a prototype in the h file as well as an implementation in the cpp file so now i am stuck between a rock and a hard place with the only seemingly way to be added abstractions in the h file for my derived classes but the spec clearly states not changing the h files so i am stuck

1535,i1zfw8x4p9nbr,176,student,0,2014-11-01T20:45:51Z,4,1470679443354,1 in the implementation of decks member function deal theres an issue of going off the end of the cards array in deal even though the requires clause states that the deck cannot be empty so the function will always return a valid card what happens when i return the last card in the array at index 51 with a newly opened deck if ive dealt all the previous 51 cards and i call deal once more the card returned would be the ace of diamonds however the next pointer would then have to increment one past cards51 which is not a valid address in the array how should i handle this is it okay to leave it be considering that the requires clause enforces the next pointer actually pointing to a valid index in the cards array and so deal would never be called in this situation 2 decks member function cardsremaining has a similar issue in order to return the correct number of cards i must add 52 to cards where cards is just the pointer to the first element in the array however adding 52 would give an address that is one past the end of the array is this okay considering that my implementation returns the correct number anyway 3 how are we to determine for every situtation which value 1 or 11 of the ace is more advantageous for the player i realize that if the players hand value is 10 and an ace is recieved then it should take the value of 11 and if the hand value is greater than 10 then 1 should be chosen but what of hand values less than 10 and what about if they are dealt two aces should one ace be 11 and the other be 1 or both of them are 1 a problem am i having is that hand does not keep track of which cards are in the hand only the total value how can we decide which value of the ace is more advantageous if we do not know what future cards will be dealt as an illustration of this lets say the player is dealt a 7 and an ace then the players hand value could be either 18 or 8 which value the ace takes depends on future cards if the player receives a king then the ace taking the value of 1 would clearly be more advantageous but if the player received a 3 then the ace should take the value of 11 but hand does not keep track of individual cards only the total if the ace is received then we must decide the value of the ace then and there how can we decide if it would be better for it to be 1 or 11

1529,i1yd9iohub61sr,146,student,0,2014-11-01T02:44:25Z,3,1470679448019,note if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some cards dealt those cards should first be restored to the deck in the order in which they were dealt preserving the most recent postshuffledpostreset state this function produces no output just so i am certain does this mean that all the cards that were dealt from the deck should return to the bottom of the deck in the same order they were dealt for example if the first two cards of an unshuffled deck were dealt 23 of spades would the last four cards of a deck before it was shuffled be kdiamond adiamond 2spade 3spade

1035,i155clpzzqf2gr,96,student,0,2014-10-11T15:57:33Z,3,1470679576623,hi all so i understand that technically under the hood a cstring is a pointer that by default is pointing to the first character in an array of chars but then if we wanted to access the other chars in this array of chars we are able to traverse this array which we could do by adding 1 2 3 etc up to the length of this array to the value of the cstring pointer because then we are just modifying the memory address that this cstring points to hoping that these above points are correct my question is then this if cstrings are technically datatypewise pointers to an array of chars are all arrays technically pointers that point to to little slices of memory holding some group of values that are in a row ex there is an array of integers called numarr holding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is numarr the pointer datatype does it then point to the memory address holding the int 1 by default thank you in advance for clarifyng this point not an intended pun but…it works ha

896,i0yink7xfg01ps,156,student,2,2014-10-07T00:35:36Z,4,1470679610857,for the last two functions in playercpp the person leadsplays a card depending on predetermined strategy but im confused as to what constitutes actually removing the card from the array i adjust handsize and reorganize the hand array so the remaining cards all fit in the first handsize positions of the array however i dont understand how to remove the lingering element i tried setting it equal to null which didnt work and i currently am assigning to it an initialized card with undefined rank and suit is this acceptable or am i missing something
895,i0yi1qlc5gb30d,91,student,0,2014-10-07T00:18:37Z,2,1470679611204,do we we have to write test cases for the functions in cardh that have already been implemented or do we only have to write test cases for the functions that we implement ourselves
894,i0yhoo3r6ex1pt,102,student,0,2014-10-07T00:08:28Z,2,1470679611429,so im trying to find the bug in my code that makes my playercpp fail the autograder the spec says each other hand must follow the led suit if able and otherwise may play any card does this mean if player 1 leads a card player 2 doesnt have to follow the led suit but player 3 does why would the spec say otherwise may play any card

891,i0yfqhv6by23as,144,student,0,2014-10-06T23:13:54Z,4,1470679612401,for the autograder checkpoint in the spec it says we only need to pass the published unit tests does this mean we need to pass only the unit tests given to us in the test cases files or some other unknown test cases that the autograder runs i guess what it boils down to is which functions within cardcpp packcpp and playercpp need to be finished and working properly or is it all of them or are we not supposed to explicitly know

321,i05qaw0bdge22q,133,student,0,2014-09-16T21:04:22Z,2,1470679756852,is it true that for any sorted binary tree and for any integer it is possible to find a place to insert that integer in the sorted binary tree my intuition tells me yes but i wanted to clarify one example is this given the wellsorted binary tree 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 if i gave inserttree an integer argument of 4 would the correct insertion be 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 4 i ask because in the spec it says the right subtree is a sorted binary tree and all elements in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the top element of the tree in this case the right subtree has top element 6 but inserting 4 would mean its less than 6 or did you guys mean the right subtree is a sorted binary tree and all elements in its right subtree are greater than or equal to the top element of the tree

3496,i8rkln7ijud71s,109,student,1,2015-04-21T17:13:21Z,2,1470670498682,the presumed strategy for this question is to create a pointer to a new empty monsterarmy then iterate through the monsterarray pointed to by other and add each element in the other monsterarray to the new empty monsterarray in reverse order but how are we supposed to iterate backwards through the other monsterarray if we do not have an overloaded prefix decrement or any mechanism linking the pointedto monsters

2768,i86vb34epai6ck,38,student,0,2015-04-07T05:29:54Z,2,1470670659447,am i correct in stating that the linked list is a memory structure that is created manually by the programmer rather than built into the language as opposed to structures like arrays which are built into the language it seems like a linked list is just a series of node structs and we create pointers to connect them and interact with them in different ways it seems like there is nothing built into the language that allows us to interact with linked lists by default
2767,i86uaxpyoufjs,54,student,0,2015-04-07T05:01:48Z,4,1470670659724,is walking the list in a linked list more memoryintensive than searching through an array i know that walking through a link list is described as memoryintensive in lecture and that linear search such as searching through an array grows linearly which i understand is not that slow they seem like similar tasks
2766,i86u6x80yui6dk,52,student,0,2015-04-07T04:58:40Z,2,1470670659937,what are the problems that could be caused by selfassignment ie the reason for checking for selfassignment at the beginning of an implementation of an overloaded assignment operator
2765,i86szyvelx4147,56,student,0,2015-04-07T04:25:16Z,3,1470670660138,hi i was wondering in project 5 why iterator begin const iterator end const and the other functions are outside the iterator class public functions
2764,i86soh9jbmc764,35,student,0,2015-04-07T04:16:20Z,3,1470670660339,could we find data stored in memory that has been leaked by invoking the address operator for instance if we have a pointer to an object called node1 and then move that pointer to a new location which would cause a memory leak could we access that object again by calling node1
2763,i86s7ydos2x6bu,85,student,0,2015-04-07T04:03:29Z,2,1470670660555,if copyall is called on a list that is not empty should it copy all of the nodes to the front of the list
2762,i86rn9gsiab4mk,122,student,1,2015-04-07T03:47:24Z,4,1470670660769,how does testing for functions that we might have added work for example i think that in lecture we were told that the big three isnt necessary for iterators but i still implemented a copy constructor and assignment operator if i include tests for them in the listtestnncpp files would they fail automatically when paired with the buggy code simply because that code might not have implemented them also would this be a problem in terms of other functions like the big three for the list class
2761,i86r5vybtkb3l8,105,student,0,2015-04-07T03:33:53Z,3,1470670660996,im trying this declaration of an iterator in stackh typename listtiterator i listfront and it keeps giving the error error no viable conversion from int to typename listintiterator i feel like it should be returning an address and using that to assign a new iterator using the overloaded operator in listh any ideas on how to fix this

2758,i86p4kje2mj2pv,152,student,0,2015-04-07T02:36:53Z,2,1470670661634,im confused as to how to overload the output operator for stackh when i declare the function as a friend in the stackh interface at the top then i get an error saying must take only one argument and when i take this declaration out then i get an error saying no match for operator should this overloaded operator be declared as a friend member function or as a nonmember function and why could i be getting these errors thanks
2757,i86ox7ij8am1o3,39,student,0,2015-04-07T02:31:09Z,3,1470670661867,in class we are learning about how to implement linked lists and the way we have written the code in class is highly dependent on pointers i was wondering how linked lists are implemented in other languages like java or python where there may not necessarily be pointers available i could be wrong are there pointers available in all these languages that allow us to follow a similar implementation style
2756,i86mq8lpjc01ma,51,student,0,2015-04-07T01:29:45Z,4,1470670662064,i keep getting this error does anyone know why
2755,i86mpth2mdc5ex,89,student,0,2015-04-07T01:29:25Z,2,1470670662282,since we overloaded the operator in list does an assignment operator between two stacks automatically make a deep copy with their member lists

2753,i86lgobxic06ft,87,student,0,2015-04-07T00:54:19Z,4,1470670662740,when we implement the default iterator constructor by calling the custom iterator constructor inside the body of the default constructor our tests fail because calling the default constructor in the end function leads to end returning iterator pointing to the first node instead of null however when we implement the default iterator constructor using a initializer list like in the lecture slides there is no problem why is this thanks

2472,i7uzrph1jo2e6,146,student,1,2015-03-29T22:01:34Z,3,1470670724701,sorry if this was asked already there are a lot of posts so it was hard to check but how ridiculous could the bugs that our test files are testing be for example if the player has a hard count and his hand totals 11 or less he hits so lets say we want one of our playertestnncpp files to test this is it necessary that we test every single hand value 11 or less to make sure he hits the only reason i can see it being necessary would be if the buggy file was coded to specifically mess up when the hand value equals something specific like 3 so my question is are there going to be bugs like this that we have to catch or will it mostly be common mistakesthings that could reasonably be unintentional obviously in the example i gave we could test it all fairly easy using a loop but there are other places where we would have to test many combinations of dealer up cards and hand values to catch bugs like this is there an easier way to catch these bugs that im missing furthermore ignoring the actual game and looking at the requirements for hand and player it is possible for a hand value to be over 21 and if we call playerdraw it should return false however since for this part of the grade we are only testing playercpp and not the game is it reasonable for this to happen and again could there be a bug where it works fine for everything except when hand value 57 then it returns true for some reason i am assuming these kind of bugs wont be tested but i wanted to make sure

2396,i7tn0yafork5z,76,student,0,2015-03-28T23:17:04Z,2,1470670741290,the spec says if your case believes the deckplayer to be incorrect it should return any value other than zero the value 1 is commonly used to denote failure assert will return a nonzero value so this is another acceptable way to test does this mean the only way i can use assert in my test functions would be return assertsomething something why i ask right now i have multiple assert statements in each test that sort of makes sure different things are correct throughout the test for example first i test and assert that adding one card 26 didnt thus incrementing count by 1 did not make the counting player bet double the minimum then if that passes i test and assert that adding one more will make the player bet double the minimum i am trying to understand how to do it this way since i cant put multiple return statements in since it would just return once the first one is correct
2395,i7tmltpr6da3rk,70,student,0,2015-03-28T23:05:19Z,2,1470670741484,for tests can we assume that there will only be one bug to test for each time for instance my partner and i have tests for deckdeal that rely on the fact that deckdeck is correct since the only way to know if your deal is coming out in the right order is if you know your deck is in the right order but our tests for deckdeck rely on the fact that deckdeal is correct since the only way you can see the cards in the deck is by dealing them all of our other tests rely upon deckdeal being correct as well i couldnt remember if this was stated in the spec so i just wanted to make sure because if both deckdeck and deckdeal are wrong that could cause some weirdness thanks in advance
2394,i7tm7y8h38n4y0,75,student,0,2015-03-28T22:54:31Z,3,1470670741694,is it ok for me to implement a getcount function thats not static that i can use for testing or should i test that independently then take it out of my final code
2393,i7tlxlkpexr4do,70,student,0,2015-03-28T22:46:28Z,2,1470670741908,lets say i make count a protected member variable in counting player lets say i also make my competitor a derived class of counting player when i define my competitor does it need to have private int count or would that just be initialized with the counting player portion

2101,i7k63y2qgyvhh,132,student,0,2015-03-22T08:13:35Z,2,1470670805863,from the specs the first set of rules apply if the player has a hard count ie hisher best total counts an ace if any for 1 not 11 the second set of rules applies if the player has a soft count i e hisher best total includes one ace worth 11 note that a hand would never count two aces as 11 each – thats a bust of 22 if a hand has two aces and one is counted as a 1 and the other is counted as 11 then the hand both counts an ace for 1 and includes one ace worth 11 therefore it is both soft and hard under the above definitions would it be better to word it this way a soft count includes an ace counted as 11 a hard count is is everything else

1349,i6h0zz7cnws5b6,151,student,0,2015-02-22T22:47:31Z,3,1470670974408,lets say the trump ordered up suit is clubs and a player has a jack of spades in hisher hand then the ledcard for a trick is also a spade the spec says that the person should play the highest card in hisher hand that follows suit of the ledcard but since the jack of spades is the left bower it is considered a club does this also mean it is no longer considered a spade for the above situation or should the person play it if heshe has no other larger spades in hisher hand i finished my whole project then ran into this during the large example test case

1051,i66subvcwmq5du,90,student,1,2015-02-15T19:01:29Z,5,1470671038662,the spec says during round two a player will order up the suit with the same color as the up card if he has one or more face cards of that suit in his hand lets say 9 hearts was the up card and a player has jack of diamonds and everything else is black in round 2 are we considering the jack of diamonds to be a diamond or a heart because we usually consider the left bowers suit to be the trump suit hearts and not diamonds would this player call trump for round 2 or pass
1050,i66sgg9sgv2ub,107,student,0,2015-02-15T18:50:41Z,2,1470671038888,in the card compare function we are supposed to return a zero if the cards are of equal value for instance a queen of hearts and a queen of diamonds if the trump and led suit were spades these two values would register as equal however we have added the notion that the cards are ordered by suit as well and therefore the queen of diamonds is of higher value than that of the queen of hearts does this mean the function should never return a zero

952,i6094jkoap4tj,113,student,0,2015-02-11T05:02:56Z,3,1470671059303,so this is a bit of a complicated question at least to explain ill do my best though lets say that i have two pointers to objectsstructs of the same type myobjorstrct pointera myobjorstrct pointerb i also have an array of objectsstructs that match the type of my pointers and a constant integer that represents its size const int size 10 myobjorstrct arrsize now consider the following code segment assume that the array has been validly initialized pointera arr for int i 0 i size i pointera pointerb arr size 1 so after the executive of the above snippet both pointers are pointing to the same element in the array namely the last element having index 9 now consider these comparisons assume that the operator has been properly overloaded for the objectstruct being used pointera pointerb returns false pointera pointerb returns true pointera pointerb returns false the first one i understand pointers are essentially memory locations containing a memory location in this case the memory locations of the two pointers are different because they are housed at different locations in memory when asked if these memory locations are equal the code returns false because they are not the same the second one i understand as well when i dereference a pointer i go to the location in memory referenced by the pointer and retrieve whatever objectstruct is held there because both pointers are pointing to the last element in the array following the array gets me the same objectstruct so the comparison operator will return true the second one can be misleading though if the array does not contain unique elements if im really interested in whether or not the two pointers are pointing to the same object and not different objects of equal value such as the same card and not just two different instances of a card that happen to have the same rank and suit then this comparison could theoretically return a false positive the third one is where i get confused because the way i am following the code it should return true first i dereference each pointer meaning that i retrieve the objectstruct held in the location in memory referenced by the pointer then i get its address by using the ampersand unary operator this should return the address in memory of that objectstruct in this specific case the objectstruct is at memory location arr size 1 because both pointers happen to point to this specific instance of the objectstruct both sides of the expression should evaluate to that single memory location where the objectstruct is held but in the code that i have run they evaluate to different locations the third one should tease out the potential error from the second one two different instances of objectsstructs that happen to be equivalent in value will still different at the location of memory ie they will be stored at different memory addresses if the two pointers fundamentally point to the exact same objectstruct and not just two objectsstructs of equal value then the memory locations should be the same even though the memory locations where the pointer variables are stored are different and must be necessarily if the pointers are not the same pointer variable im just not sure why the third case is evaluating the way it is if something that i have said is inaccurate anywhere then thats probably why and id be very grateful if it were pointed out if what i said is right and my code should be evaluating the way i think it should then i must have a bug somewhere else in my code that im misunderstanding when debugging if that is the case ill bring my specific lines of c in to office hours and tease through them with an instructor however i want to make sure that im understanding the arithmetic and concepts on top of just making sure that my code runs properly thank youand again sorry about the length i wanted to be thorough in my explanation and setup so that my thought process was as clear as possible

745,i5niu6ct1yw2ct,77,student,0,2015-02-02T07:13:48Z,2,1470671104607,just to seek clarification is it necessary to include recursiveh in either p2cpp or p2testcpp given that i have already included p2h in the header i guess i am not clear about include in general since recursiveh has already been included in p2h does this mean that whenever i include p2h i get access to the functions in recursiveh

680,i5m0xl9jw3pdf,62,student,1,2015-02-01T06:04:48Z,3,1470671118759,in my p2cpp ive made a helper function that converts lists to arrays as well as a helper function that gets the length of a list when i try to initialize an array to have a const int length i get this error in the compiler p2cpp26010 error variable length arrays are a c99 feature werrorwvlaextension int arrbsizeb does this mean the autograder does not accept variable length arrays am i not allowed to do this thanks

676,i5lwjl067o774r,111,student,0,2015-02-01T04:01:56Z,3,1470671119649,if we wrote sum and product using accumulate and wrote filterodd and filtereven using filter we basically testing filter when we call sum and product and the same for filterodd and filtereven do we still have to write test case for filter and accumulate also are we required to write sum and product using accumulate and write filterodd filter even using filter

668,i5lswr937t0x9,80,student,0,2015-02-01T02:20:12Z,2,1470671121201,if you have a list a 1 2 3 and another list b 4 5 6 and your index to place b in a is larger than as size lets say 5 one index past putting b at the end of a should this return an error or should this be a corner case that returns something else like it just returns 1 2 3 4 5 6 should we assume that all test cases will always give us an inbounds index

658,i5lm34dvbtj7p7,146,student,3,2015-01-31T23:09:12Z,7,1470671123513,this function is troubling me as the nature of this function is a little different from the rest in that there are not explicit edge cases we can test for it either is or it is not and there are countless possibilities that need to be tested its easy enough to test if containedby returns true when necessary but there are far too many possibilities to effectively test for when containedby should return false what would be a sufficient series of tests for this particular function

646,i5lg0cyluw07jn,162,student,0,2015-01-31T20:19:05Z,7,1470671126425,just for the clarification reasons containedby and coveredby do the same thing right in my understanding coveredby is just an optional helper function to containedby is it correct
645,i5lfssbxvsp414,98,student,0,2015-01-31T20:13:12Z,3,1470671126651,hello everyone ive got some question about function pointer for accumulate it seems like the accumulate function has int fnint int however the earlier sum and product implementations only have list type for the input instead of two int how am i supposed to deal with this thanks

436,i5be6d6l3zg6qx,96,student,0,2015-01-24T19:30:04Z,2,1470671173915,is there a way to make a tree iterativelyrecursively using treemake the only way i could figure out to make a tree was to make 2 empty trees and then build on them working up from the bottom of the tree to the node this will take a while though and i was hoping for a more efficient way to do it thanks
435,i5bdra0mhx27a9,113,student,0,2015-01-24T19:18:21Z,2,1470671174134,im trying to do listt lst 2 3 4 but it keeps giving an error so im a little confused on how to make a list
434,i5bchppza3v41a,103,student,0,2015-01-24T18:42:55Z,2,1470671174355,in testing lists is it possible to use assert the operator doesnt seem to have been overloaded for lists would it be best to just output the expected list and the actual list and compare the two manually
433,i5bbtfxpkw24ol,199,student,0,2015-01-24T18:24:02Z,5,1470671174579,there is some of p2s spec that im not fully understand 1 what does product do what it means by returns the product of each element 2 what is identity in the accumulate function and what does fn do and i really dont know what accumulate is supposed to do 3 and for append is it just simply combine 2 lists into 1
432,i5bacwowslt2u9,161,student,1,2015-01-24T17:43:11Z,2,1470671174790,so if fn were defined to be the sum of its two inputs then accumulate would return the sum of every element in the list plus identity and if fn were defined to be the product of its two inputs then accumulate would return the product of every element in the list times identity from another piazza post i understand function pointers so would using accumulate with an fn sum of two ints on a list 3 2 1 with identity 2 be 3 2 1 2 8 or 3 2 2 2 1 2 12
431,i5b9s2epc373k4,82,student,0,2015-01-24T17:26:59Z,2,1470671175021,can we use multiple files for our test cases or is it ok to have a file that is upwards of 1000 lines of code right now i am printing everything so that number may be a little high but it is still up there

429,i5b3juqzs4k2uj,94,student,0,2015-01-24T14:32:38Z,2,1470671175445,is this file just for our own use or should we be putting our filter test functions in there or just follow that format
428,i5b3905eaf81w,61,student,0,2015-01-24T14:24:12Z,2,1470671175724,is it legal to use a counter variable as a base case in a tail recursive function ie have a function that starts at 0 and then the base case is when it equal the integer in the parameter of the given function
427,i5b36suby766e2,148,student,0,2015-01-24T14:22:29Z,2,1470671175929,i am making my test lists right now but i am having trouble making the second list to compare it with for some of my edge cases right now i have made all the lists and i am just printing everything out and checking it by hand but i have no clue how to build a bench mark list for some of my more complicated test cases especially from functions such as rotate and insert where i am putting numbers in out of order should i try to make my test cases so all of the answers are easy or is there some way to overload a list thanks

421,i5a9jhl0iva738,134,student,0,2015-01-24T00:32:32Z,2,1470671177303,i think im getting these definitions mixed up so to clarify effects returns true if a is covered by b or if a is contained by either of bs subtrees if a and b 4 4 2 5 2 5 3 1 3 if using the func containedbyab it would return true correct cause all of a is inside b and trees like 5 2 3 1 would return false but 4 would return true

413,i59woym5ppv4de,134,student,0,2015-01-23T18:32:53Z,3,1470671178999,i am a little confused about the idea of writing helper functions for tail recursion is is acceptable for the helper function to be recursive but not tail recursive does the tail recursive function only return the helper function no matter what the input is if this is the case then what is the point of tail recursion in general although you are reusing the stack frame for the original function isnt that idea of reusing the stack frame being negated by the fact that youre creating a lot of stack frames in the helper function

316,i53g5w2ybgb4o7,224,student,14,2015-01-19T06:03:32Z,5,1470671200701,i see a lot of people having issues setting up a workflow for this class and i thought id give my opinion on the most efficient way to code i tried to write this for both mac and windows users i use a mac so this is more geared towards mac people and some windows configurations might be wrong read each tip before doing anything in case you decide you dont like my workflow downloading project files mac i personally use dropbox for all my important documents in case my computer crashes you may also want to store your files online to be safe download the p2targz file from the eecs 280 google drive manually not with wget and put it into a folder of your choosing navigate to the containing directory in terminal and use this command to unzip the file tar ­xzvf p2targz unzipping the file puts its contents into a new folder automatically make sure you type this as copying it in will not work sublime text mac and windows i use a program named sublime text 3 for most of my coding you can spend the time to learn vim if you want and i prefer it for quick fixes but you dont need to know how to use it xcode and visual studio are nice because you press a button the code compiles and it runs but that is not useful when you have more than one main function sublime text has some nice features such as tabs and splitwindows which make it easier to view and edit code sublime text is capable of syntax checking think the red squiggly lines in xcode im not going to outline it here but you can set up a c linter mac only sublime text lets you view a folders files in a sidebar use the open command commando controlo navigate to the folder containing all your project files and then click open if your files dont all show up on the left use view » sidebar » show sidebar to view multiple files at once use view » layout to set up multiple columns ssh alias mac follow the first part of this guide to set up an ssh alias making signing into caen less of a chore syncing with caen mac you want to test your code in caen so that you can ensure that the graders see the same output as you a nice explanation of how to keep files in sync with caen can be found here after testing your code locally you can then copy your files into caen and verify that the output is the same syncing with caen windows because the steps for mac dont apply to you one option is to write your code in sublime text and use git to transfer files between github and caen you can follow the steps below on using git to set up your files on your local machine code locally push from your machine pull to caen and then run your code using g git does not come preinstalled on windows so you need to download it make sure to select command prompt instead of git shell when installing using git with github mac windows caen this project also is the first in which we are allowed to have partners one effective way to share your code is using github here is a guide on creating a git repository using terminal or command prompt make sure you set up your project as a private repository to not break the honor code in the project go to settings » collaborators to add your partner you can get 5 free private repositories by getting the github student developer pack it took about a week to process my application remember how to use the command line cd to change directories cd to go up one directory ls windows dir to view the folders and files in your current directory pwd windows echo cd to see which directory youre in these are commands to download pull and upload push code once you are in the project directory to download code git pull origin master to prepare to upload code you must first save commit it git commit m message here to upload code git push origin master make sure you and your partner dont work on the same functions simultaneously because youll get merge errors which suck if your partner set up the private repository instead of you navigate to the directory in which you want to store the project download the project files using this command git clone url from the github page you can get the url from this box in the github page using a makefile windows users you need to be on caen to do this mac users you can do this on both your local machine and caen this project introduced a new type of file called a makefile theyre useful because you type in one or two words to compile your code unlike the last project where you typed a bunch of g for this project just type this in make this compiles all of the programs that you can run if you only want to compile one of them you can invoke make with a target make target where target is one of the keywords in the makefile they gave you to see what these targets are open the makefile the options are not indented and are followed by a colon all filtertest simpletest treeinserttest p2tests test filtertest simpletest treeinserttest p2tests simpletest

werror pedantic o2 p2testscpp p2cpp recursivelistcpp binarytreecpp recursivecpp testhelperscpp o p2tests here we have three targets all test and p2tests compiling code will result in one of two things it will display the g command and either exit or show you the compile errors once the make command has succeeded you can run the generated programs for example after compiling p2tests you would run the program like this p2tests this will run the code as if you had clicked run on xcode or visual studio other notes debugging using gdb and g flags are explained well in the lab01 document so look there for instructions in the command line pressing up will go to the previous input making it easier to remember commands

3662,ii8cv9o36kl5dv,78,student,0,2015-12-16T05:06:19Z,4,1470673378055,would the deconstructors be run when int main ends for the dynamic memory or is are they only run when delete is called

3660,ii8blmavz4x7l2,53,student,0,2015-12-16T04:30:49Z,4,1470673378539,im unsure what drawing this would look like intset isp new intset delete isp isp 0 would isp point to a class in the heap what does it look like as a class like is it a big box the class itself with littler boxes inside it representing all the member variables and functions and then its deleted like any old variable at the end ie crossed off at delete isp

3656,ii87kvbceya47l,72,student,0,2015-12-16T02:38:16Z,4,1470673379361,i dont completely understand what setting a pointer to 0 does say a pointer ptr is pointing to an object on the heap if you were to do ptr 0 before doing delete ptr would that mean that ptr now points to 0 or that the thing ptr is pointing to becomes 0 and if it is the former then does that mean there is a memory leak because there is no way of deleting the heap object because there is no way of accessing it

3584,ii6928q7bvi4bz,49,student,1,2015-12-14T17:44:13Z,6,1470673397172,when you have dynamic variables so theyre stored in the heap not the stack and you pass them by value into a function what happens i know a copy of the variable is created but is that copy stored in the heap or the stack and do you need a destructor so that when the function ends the variable is destroyed
3583,ii68tu0jiuq22,63,student,0,2015-12-14T17:37:41Z,4,1470673397409,is this valid int arr new int4 for int i 0 i 4 i arri 3 my thinking is that its not valid because int arr is an integer pointer to the first element of the dynamic array therefore you cant index arr to fill the dynamic array arr points to you would have to do i 3 i i 4 and so on

3576,ii5epgnjn9z5dp,76,student,0,2015-12-14T03:34:29Z,5,1470673399249,in an interface class if the derived classes have data members that will be created dynamically do you have to create pure virtual destructors copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators also the lecture slides says that an interface class doesnt have a constructor this makes sense from the perspective that the interface only class cannot be instantiated but wouldnt all derived classes call the base class constructor does this mean that it is default created for you
3575,ii5cgncgriz4sj,50,student,0,2015-12-14T02:31:38Z,4,1470673399545,i was looking over this unit and i noticed that an example of a derived class is isosceles public triangle im wondering where exactly did public come from it has nothing to do with public and private within classes so thank you

3572,ii59cljqekc5b6,80,student,0,2015-12-14T01:04:30Z,5,1470673400321,to be adt is that were you need at least 1 virtual function or was it at least 1 pure virtual function or is it something else where thats the requirement also for polymorphism is it the same thing
3570,ii54e3ynsoz29i,88,student,0,2015-12-13T22:45:43Z,5,1470673400820,so since for 5a unhandled exception is printed so this means after throw derivedstrings executes the function returns and then its caught in main aka after derivedstrings is thrown this function returns and thus does not go to the caught something catch in the same function correct

3506,ii26g4hcqxw3g1,57,student,0,2015-12-11T21:19:58Z,4,1470673415892,can you use insert if the iterator you send it is listend i think it would be yes since that is an iterator associated with the list even though it would be a null pointer thanks
3504,ii25vmnyp1l1pk,58,student,0,2015-12-11T21:04:01Z,4,1470673416340,since make listtests complies runs and uses valgrind on our code can we assume valgrind will catch any memory leaks when our test cases are graded so since we have no way to assert if there is a memory leak we just have to make sure to test the possibility knowing that valgrind will catch it

3443,ii15a8g7yis7jm,54,student,0,2015-12-11T03:59:37Z,4,1470673431681,in my project i have pretty much the exact code from this lecture slide but i dont understand how its bad and why its giving me an error in xcode the error im getting is pointer being freed was not allocated the way i understand it is the code makes a node pointer to the node that is going to be deleted and then moves the first pointer to the node thats next to it and then deletes the node once there is one node left and its called to be deleted the first pointer will be null then itll delete the last node and wont be called again in the slides it says to delete zoofirst but i dont understand because isnt that deleting a potential int and thus not allowed this issue has been my bottleneck for the past few hours with regards to the project so any help is much appreciated
3442,ii159vfofok4ca,59,student,1,2015-12-11T03:59:20Z,4,1470673431881,so all of my tests for list yield no memory leaks when i run stackpublictest with valgrind i get a still reachable leak the curious thing is that i commented out tests to try and figure out where it is coming from even after commenting out all of test calls it still has the same issue how does that work

3429,ii11zjxc5qd4p9,40,student,0,2015-12-11T02:27:20Z,5,1470673434975,so pretty much whenever i call delete im getting unexpected results for a long time i thought it was working but stepping through more carefully reveals that it is setting the victim 0 after the delete that is doing all of the work for me lets say i call delete on a node pointer ndptr after ndptr has been set equal to firstptr so something like ndptr firstptr delete ndptr shouldnt this set all of the addresses and values of all the elements in ndptr and firstptr to null if not why not thanks so much

3209,ihwppqh31bl4zo,58,student,0,2015-12-08T01:32:42Z,4,1470673488227,so first let me say that yes i searched on piazza and yes i found a post relating to this exact thing i am still unsure as to how this works and want to make sure that i am doing this right before i break something the post i saw was 2942 i just want to double check that running this command chmod x runmytestsp will not break anything
3207,ihwnz5bh59e3l,73,student,0,2015-12-08T00:44:02Z,5,1470673488660,are we allow to create a helper function within iterator class to help retrieve the nodeptr
3206,ihwn14c93ve2c2,109,student,0,2015-12-08T00:17:34Z,5,1470673488864,in the spec it says n negate negate the top item on the stack however it doesnt specify if it requires a stack of at least one operand like other operations described in the section it makes sense that there should be at least one operand but it doesnt specify should we assume this or should we just make calc do nothing when the stack is empty and n is an input
3205,ihwlncnaeuh30d,102,student,0,2015-12-07T23:38:52Z,5,1470673489069,hello where should nodeptr point after the erase deletes the current node the one before after or does it not matter thanks in advance
3204,ihwkuuge8jv6af,46,student,0,2015-12-07T23:16:42Z,4,1470673489279,to clarify when there is 1 node in the list first points to the node and last points to 0 correct
3203,ihwj9ucztkm2nf,69,student,0,2015-12-07T22:32:23Z,4,1470673489484,in our list assignment operator should we be calling copyall before we assign the first and last pointers do we even need to call copyall
3201,ihwi7r6b7856up,75,student,0,2015-12-07T22:02:45Z,5,1470673489882,can someone explain why this error occurs template typename u is included in my code right before the function
3200,ihwhvpwx8oz51w,100,student,0,2015-12-07T21:53:24Z,3,1470673490158,when i am trying to print a stack i use an iterator to go through the list within the stack and i am failing the assert of a null pointer i used gdb and when i get to the dereference operator for iterator it says this synthetic pointer what does this mean
3199,ihwh0vb6v844gq,130,student,2,2015-12-07T21:29:25Z,4,1470673490371,i read the spec but am confused about what exactly the q quit command does what does it mean by exit calculator with a 0 exit value and how would we account for the typing controld must also cause the calculator to exit with status 0 i wouldve thought just exit0 but it says not to because of memory leaks thanks
3198,ihwg8elmf4d56s,143,student,4,2015-12-07T21:07:17Z,4,1470673490575,how do we know when to start stop reading user input we dont give a prompt to start so do we just sit at cin until the user realizes to enter something and if thats the case im still unsure of when to stop thanks
3196,ihwelj1i7sl2mv,120,student,1,2015-12-07T20:21:30Z,6,1470673490998,i know that calling exit0 causes memory leaks because the destructor never runs and nodes are left uncleaned up but why does that is that a problem since the program just ended all its memory gets freed up anyway right
3195,ihweh9cxtbs484,135,student,0,2015-12-07T20:18:10Z,6,1470673491215,if an iterator points to a null is it deferenceable
3194,ihwe3zmpjko3w9,183,student,0,2015-12-07T20:07:51Z,7,1470673492393,so ive tried searching on piazza for some insight but im still pretty confused as to how were supposed to implement calccpp from the spec i can see that we should write different helper functions based on which command is inputted however i dont understand how the input works from the spec i see that it will be well formatted with a space after each operation but that leaves me with the following questions 1 are the commands being read in from a file or from some form of user input 2 if user input are we supposed to read in an entire string of commands and dissect it for what were supposed to do 3 after we perform each line of operations do we scrap the stack and start with a new one or are we supposed to build off of the previous one i know we can have lines with multiple operations like 4 5 2 but i mean different lines of operation like 4 5 2 and 6 7 2 thanks
3192,ihwdtc10r592xa,79,student,0,2015-12-07T19:59:34Z,5,1470673492897,in lab 11 i wrote animal a i then used the pointer a to use variables like getname looking back over this it doesnt make sense to me in listh the operator overload function returns a reference to t but a is a pointer so these types dont match up how did this work
3191,ihwdh1s6d534dt,99,student,0,2015-12-07T19:50:01Z,4,1470673493123,the project spec tells us to be very specific in each of our cpp files does this mean that each file should only contain one test of a function for example would it be alright to test pushfront and pushback on an empty list within the same cpp file or would i need to create a new cpp file for each individual test thanks

2801,ih7s2qgrc252vw,61,student,0,2015-11-20T14:44:33Z,7,1470673586525,should we print out march when a team does march or only print out when euchred
2800,ih7nt54ne8u6tn,91,student,0,2015-11-20T12:45:07Z,4,1470673586730,im going through my implementation for cardtests extensively trying to find out where i may have wrong logic but im not finding anything that is causing my return code to be incorrect i already checked that i am including only the things that i need and i dont see anything wrong with the logic could a possible reason for the error be that i am comparing the same 2 cards when testing cardless what other issues could be causing this anyone who has fixed stuff in their code to get return code to be correct please let me know what you did thanks
