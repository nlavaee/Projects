# Overview

The goal for this project is to write an intelligent program that can classify Piazza* posts according to topic. 
This task is easy for humans - we simply read and understand the content of the post, and the topic is intuitively clear. 
But how do we compose an algorithm to do the same? We can’t just tell the computer to “look at it” and understand. 
This is typical of problems in artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

The focus was on delving deeper into recursion, binary trees, templates, comparators, and the map data structure.

*Piazza is a Q&A web service. It can be described as "mixture between a wiki and a forum" that can be used with 
learning management systems.
