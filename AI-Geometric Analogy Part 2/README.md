# Project Overview

This project was the second part of the initial Geometric Analogy problem. 

A geometric analogy problem A:B::C:, meaning “A is to B as C is to what?”, is expressed as eight diagrams: 
A, B, and C, and the (usually five) possible answers k, for k∈{1,2,3,4,5}. To solve the problem, we 
need to find a transformation A→B, and five (or more) transformations C→1, C→2, C→3, C→4, and C→5, such 
that one of the transformations C→k is the best match for A→B. The answer is then k.

The goal of the project was to take the output generated by Part 1 in order to develop a program that could
correctly predict the answers to geometric analogy problems. An example of the input can be seen in the Part1_input folder,
and the output of the program from Part1_output. The information in the output is run through an algorithm (detailed in the
reports folder) to produce k = #, identifying the correct answer for the problem.
