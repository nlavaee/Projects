# Unsupervised and Supervised Learning

In the supervised setting, this project used deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
classify dog images by breed, where the breed associated with each image serves as the
classification label. In the unsupervised setting, I worked iwth a continuous valued 
feature vector as the feature representation for each input image. The unsupervised part
involved using the autoencoder since we had large amounts of unlabeled data.

For the challenge portion of this project, I employed Pytorch to design, implement, and train
a deep neural netowrk of my own design in order to classify dog breeds. I had a really, really
fun time do this and playing around with different models. My model is implemented in
model/challenge.py.
