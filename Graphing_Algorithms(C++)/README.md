# Overview
The concept behind this project was to devise a systematic way to feed the animals within a zoo.
The task was to identify the most efficient routes for providing food & water to the animals.


# Project Goals
Understand and implement MST algorithms. Be able to determine whether Prim's or Kruskal's is more efficient for a particular scenario.
Understand and implement a Branch and Bound algorithm. Develop a fast and effective bounding algorithm.
Explore various heuristic approaches to achieving a nearly-optimal solution as fast as possible.
