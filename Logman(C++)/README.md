# Overview
The program will begin by reading an input file containing log entries, and then will enter an interactive mode where the user can perform timestamp, category, and keyword searches for the purpose of constructing an "excerpt list" of the log file. Logman also allows the user to manage and display this "excerpt list" to identify the important/relevant entries of their log file.

A lot of thought was spent on the design portion of this project in order to determine what data
structures to use to make the most optimal and efficient program, and involved much thought into
how these data structures would interact with one another.
