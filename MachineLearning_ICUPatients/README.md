# Predicting Survival of ICU Patients

With the rapid advancement of technology, hospitals are creating and collecting vast
amounts of data about their patients.  These data, stored in the electronic health record, 
have the potential to impact clinical carein a variety of ways, e.g., in identifying patients 
at greatest risk of an adverse outcome, in predicting the efficacy of a particular drug, or in 
matching patients with the best treatments. In this project, I worked with a subset 
of data collected from patients admitted to an intensive care  unit  at  the  Beth  Israel  
Deaconess  Medical  Center  in  Boston. I developed classification tools that  
automatically  identify  patients  at  risk  of  in-hospital  mortality.   Such  a  model  
could  help  clinicians target interventions,  facilitating better management and improved patient outcomes.   
These data represent real patient admissions and real outcomes; they have been made available 
for researchand educational purposes by PhysioNet.org.  Such datasets are critical to the fundamental advancement 
of clinical-decision support tools.

I received the skeleton of these files and proceeded to write the functions in order to perform feature extraction,
Hyperparameter & model selection [Linear & RBF Kernel SVM]. I also handled class imbalanced data and how to properly
set class weights.
