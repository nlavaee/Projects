# Project Overview

Given a set of coordinates, the task was to identify (1) the correct objects and their intrinsic properties, and 
(2) the extrinsic relations among the objects. The easy cases involved diagrams where all objects were
disjoint. The harder ones involved diagrams where the objects overlapped or interestected.

Examples of the program output are provided in the reports folder. For instance, if the input D1.png has three 
interpretations, then the output would be D1a.png, D1a.txt, D1b.png, D1b.txt, D1c.png, and D1c.txt
after running the program.
